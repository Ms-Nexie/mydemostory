Super Human Abilities:
On the night of the gift it is speculated that Lioness was somehow fused with a spider which appears to be
the source of her powers. She can stick to walls and she can produce a web like substance from her hands
with incredible tensile strength.
She has superhuman strength; being able to lift/press approximately 12 tons and she possesses superhuman
speed, stamina, agility and refexes.
Lioness also has the ability when under extreme stress to turn into a human/spider hybrid. When this change
takes place she grows to around 7ft tall, 4 extra arms rip from her side, she develops 6 extra eyes and all her
abilities increase by at least a factor of 10.
Lioness however does not like to transform into this form and has kept it a secret, she does her best to stay
calm so the metamorphosis does not take place.

Strength Level:
Lioness in her “normal” form can lift/press 12 tons, but when she becomes the human/spider hybrid her
strength is greatly increased and she moves into the class 100 strength category being able to lift/press in
excess of 100 tons.

Weaknesses:
Lioness is an extremely powerful and talented super hero, with some truly incredible abilities, however her
one true weakness is her own fear of thinking she is not good enough to take on the big guns in New Accra.
She doubts herself, and has the constant fear that someone will fnd out about her secret; she seldom
commits fully to taking down the bad guys.
