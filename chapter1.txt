Intro of the Lioness:

On the night of â€œThe Gift"  Isabel was chilling at home watching the unbelievable news of the return of Heru!
She was watching the news coverage of all that was happening in Black Star Square, the place where Heru
had tried to save the protesters. A mass black out took place and all the electricity in her apartment shut
of. Isabel went to use the bathroom and when she entered her bathroom she noticed a large spider on the
wall, not a lover of spiders she went to hit the spider with her slipper, just as she made contact with it a
huge explosion went of outside and her bathroom window burst in on her. A blinding light flled the room
and she was knocked unconscious. 72 hours later she woke and was changed. She could stick to walls,
shoot webs, camoufage to her environment, jump extremely high and when under extreme stress 4 arms
rip from the side of her body, she develops 6 extra eyes and her mouth extends and opens sideways much
like a giant spider. She was reborn with superhuman abilities, but as mentioned before she was not a fan of
spiders and refused to name her new alter ego anything to do with them... She decided on Lioness; ferce,
brave, proud and strong. Lioness was approached by Mega Man to join a group of superheroes called the
New So Solid Crew, and Lioness was the frst person to join making her a founding member.
